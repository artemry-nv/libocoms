Open Component Module Serves (OCOMS)


OCOMS is a stand alone light-weight network utility library. It provides
components and functionality to build module component architecture (MCA) based 
network libraries. The code is based on Open MPI's subproject Open Portability 
Abstraction Layer (OPAL). The OCOMS library provides same functionality as 
OPAL while providing the ability to be integrated with other network libraries.
